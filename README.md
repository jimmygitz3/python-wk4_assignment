# 📝 File Handling & Error Management Project 

## 👋 Introduction

This project was completed as part of my coursework on Python programming. The goal was to practice reading from and writing to files, as well as implementing proper error handling when working with user input and file operations.

## 🖋️ Task 1: File Read & Write Challenge

For this part of the assignment, I created a Python script that:
- Prompts the user for the name of an input file.
- Reads the contents of the file.
- Applies a transformation to the text (in my case, I converted all text to uppercase).
- Writes the modified content to a new output file.

This helped me understand how to use Python’s `open()` function and how to work with file objects using the `with` statement.

## 🧪 Task 2: Error Handling Lab

In the second part, I added error handling to make the program more robust. Specifically, I:
- Used `try` and `except` blocks to catch `FileNotFoundError`.

This part taught me how important it is to anticipate and handle exceptions, especially when dealing with user input and external files.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- VS Code (for writing and testing the code)

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to read from and write to files in Python.
- How to use context managers (`with open(...)`) for safer file handling.
- How to implement basic error handling using `try`and `except`.

## 🚀 How to Run the Program

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Save the script as `code_1.py` and 'code_2.py'.
3. Prepare a sample text file (`input.txt`) and ('output.txt') in the same directory.
4. Run the scripts:
